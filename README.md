# Discord Bot - Tim's Bot

This bot is for Role Management in a Discord Server in which I am part of. Our Discord Server is an unofficial server for Azusa Pacific Unversity's ECS Department.
In this server, we have channels for most of the classes and it is just a place for us to hang out and get help for classes. Before, we, the admins, had to manually 
put the roles of each person to give them access to the channels.

## Package Used
```bash
$ npm install discord.js
```
